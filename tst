As you undergo this major surgery, please know that my thoughts and prayers are with you every step of the way. Your determination and courage inspire me, Achim. Remember the times we spoke about meeting one day when our app succeeds? Those conversations filled me with hope and excitement, and I believe in my heart that we will celebrate that success together.

Your willingness to go above and beyond, like when you sent me medicine from Germany when I was unwell, speaks volumes about the caring person you are. Your generosity and compassion know no bounds, Achim, and I am forever grateful to have you in my life.

I want you to focus on your recovery now, Achim. Take each day as it comes, and know that you have a support system rooting for you from across the globe. Your strength and resilience are truly remarkable, and I have no doubt that you will emerge from this stronger than ever before.
